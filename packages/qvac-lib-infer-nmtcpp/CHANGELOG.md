and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.9] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Fix pivot translation (e.g. ES → IT via EN) hanging indefinitely after C++ translation completes
- Root cause: `PivotTranslationModel::runtimeStats()` prefixes stats keys with the model name (e.g. `"BERGAMOT : es->enTPS"`), but `_addonOutputCallback` only checked for exact `"TPS"` key to detect job completion — the prefixed key never matched, so `JobEnded` was never fired and the response hung until timeout
- Replace hardcoded key checks with `Object.keys(data).some(k => k.endsWith('TPS'))` which handles all key formats

### Changed

- Updated workflows and actions from main

## [0.6.8] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Bumped `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` vcpkg dependency to >=1.1.5
- Pin iOS builds to macos-14 runner for compatibility with 0.6.x overlay ports

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-06

This release enhances the JavaScript interface for pivot translation support in Bergamot models. The improvements make it easier to configure pivot translation workflows through a dedicated configuration object, with better separation of concerns between primary and pivot model resources.

## Features

### Enhanced Pivot Translation Configuration

The JavaScript interface now supports a dedicated `bergamotPivotModel` configuration object that encapsulates all pivot-specific settings. This allows users to specify separate loaders, disk paths, model names, vocabulary files, and configurations for the pivot model independently from the primary model. The pivot model's vocabulary paths are now correctly passed under the `config` object, following Bergamot's expected structure for proper initialization. Each model in the pivot chain can use its own resource loader, enabling more flexible deployment scenarios where models might be stored in different locations or retrieved through different mechanisms.

## Bug Fixes

### Pivot Model Example Corrections

Fixed incorrect model names in the pivot translation example that prevented the example from running successfully. The example now uses the correct model file names for the translation pipeline.

## Other

Minor improvements to code organization include fixing a typo in log messages ("supplued" → "supplied") and consolidating pivot vocabulary configuration logic for better maintainability.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- Cancellation support for pivot translation by implementing `IModelCancel` in `PivotTranslationModel`.

### Changed
- Aligned pivot translation internals with the shared addon model lifecycle and updated model interface wiring for `PivotTranslationModel`.
- Updated native build integration so pivot translation sources are compiled and linked consistently across package targets.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-05

This release adds pivot translation support so a single request can be translated through an intermediate language using two configured models. It also aligns the translation model with the shared `IModel` interface to improve consistency with other inference add-ons. Together, these updates make multi-hop translation flows easier to configure while preserving existing single-model usage.

## Features

Pivot translation is now available through a dedicated `PivotTranslationModel` that chains two `TranslationModel` instances and supports both single-text and batch processing flows. The JavaScript addon creation path now detects optional `pivotModel` configuration and automatically initializes either the pivot pipeline or the existing single-model pipeline based on user configuration. Build integration was updated to compile and link the new pivot model implementation as part of the addon.

## Other

The package API surface was cleaned up by promoting `processBatch` to the public `TranslationModel` interface to support pivot composition, and by removing unused includes in translation model headers and implementation files.
