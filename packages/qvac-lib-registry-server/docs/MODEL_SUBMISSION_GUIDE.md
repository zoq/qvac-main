# Model Submission Guide

## Adding a New Model

1. Add entry to `data/models.prod.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/resolve/<commit>/<file>",
     "engine": "@qvac/<engine-name>",
     "license": "MIT",
     "quantization": "q4_0",
     "params": "1B",
     "tags": ["generation", "instruct"],
     "description": "",
     "notes": "",
     "link": "https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>"
   }
   ```

2. If the model uses a license not already in `data/licenses.json`, add a new entry there and place the full license text at `data/licenses/<license-id>/LICENSE.txt`.
3. Run validation: `npm run validate:models`
4. Submit PR targeting `main`

### Source URL Formats

- HuggingFace: `https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/resolve/<commit>/<path>`
- S3: `s3:///<key>` (bucket name is resolved from `QVAC_S3_BUCKET` environment variable)

Pin to specific commit/version. Avoid `main` or `latest`.

The S3 bucket name is **not** stored in `models.prod.json`. Set `QVAC_S3_BUCKET` in your `.env` file.
The server resolves the bucket at runtime when downloading artifacts.

### S3 Date Folder Requirement

S3 source paths **must** include a date folder (`YYYY-MM-DD`) identifying when the artifact was uploaded:

```
s3:///qvac_models_compiled/<type>/<model-name>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<filename>
```

Example:
```
s3:///qvac_models_compiled/ggml/Llama-3.2-1B/2025-12-04/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_0.gguf
```

**Why**: The registry tracks models by their source URL. If a model binary is replaced at the same S3 path, the registry has no way to detect the change — checksums, file sizes, and content become inconsistent without any visible update. Dated directories guarantee each version has a unique path. When updating a model, upload the new version to a new date folder and submit a new registry entry (deprecating the old one if needed).

The validation script enforces this for all new S3 entries. Legacy paths predating this rule are listed in `data/s3-legacy-paths.json`.

### Registry Sync Process

The staging registry syncs **automatically on merge to `main`**. No manual labels required.

1. Submit PR targeting `main` with `models.prod.json` changes.
2. Ensure validation passes (the `validate-json` job runs on PRs with the `verify` label).
3. Once approved, merge to `main`. The `sync-staging` pipeline triggers automatically on push to `main` when `models.prod.json` is modified.

How sync works:

- The sync process compares the full `models.prod.json` against the current database state and applies **all** differences — not just changes from the current PR. If a previous PR was merged without triggering a sync, its changes will be included in the next sync run.
- A `workflow_dispatch` trigger is available for manual sync when needed.

## Deprecating a Model

Add deprecation fields to existing entry:
```json
{
  "source": "...",
  "deprecated": true,
  "replacedBy": "<full-source-url-of-replacement>",
  "deprecationReason": "Superseded by v2"
}
```

The `replacedBy` field must reference a model that exists in the same JSON file. The sync script will automatically set `deprecatedAt` timestamp when deprecating.

## Undeprecating a Model

To reverse a deprecation (e.g., deprecated by mistake), set `deprecated: false`:
```json
{
  "source": "...",
  "deprecated": false
}
```

The sync script will clear all deprecation fields (`deprecatedAt`, `replacedBy`, `deprecationReason`) automatically.

## Removing a Model

**Default**: Deprecate the model (see above) rather than removing it from the JSON file.

If you remove an entry from `models.prod.json`, the sync script will auto-deprecate it in the database with reason "Removed from configuration". The model data is preserved.

**For permanent deletion**: Create a ticket with the reason for deletion. Manual intervention required.

## Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `source` | Yes | URL to model file (`https://huggingface.co/...` or `s3:///key`) |
| `engine` | Yes | Engine identifier (e.g., `@qvac/llm-llamacpp`) |
| `license` | Yes | License identifier matching an entry in `data/licenses.json` |
| `quantization` | No | Quantization format (e.g., `q4_0`, `q8_0`) |
| `params` | No | Model parameter count (e.g., `1B`, `4B`) |
| `description` | No | Human-readable description |
| `notes` | No | Additional notes |
| `tags` | No | Array of tag strings |
| `link` | No | URL to the model's HuggingFace page or project. Required for S3-hosted models to provide traceability back to the original source. |
| `deprecated` | No | Boolean flag for deprecation |
| `replacedBy` | No | Source URL of replacement model |
| `deprecationReason` | No | Reason for deprecation |

Note: `deprecatedAt` timestamp is auto-generated when syncing to the database.

### License Files

Each license used in `models.prod.json` must have:

1. An entry in `data/licenses.json` with `spdxId`, `name`, and `url`.
2. A full license text at `data/licenses/<spdxId>/LICENSE.txt`.

Existing licenses: `Apache-2.0`, `MIT`, `llama3.2`, `gemma`, `health-ai-developer-foundations`, `MPL-2.0`, `CC-BY-4.0`, `openrail`.

When adding a model with a new license, include the license file in the same PR.
