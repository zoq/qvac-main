# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.5]

### Added
- Added opt-in conversation streaming events to `runStreaming()`. Callers can pass `emitVadEvents`, `endOfTurnSilenceMs`, and `vadRunIntervalMs` to receive `{ type: "vad" }` state updates and `{ type: "endOfTurn" }` silence boundary events alongside transcript segments.
- Added native `VadStateUpdate` and `EndOfTurnEvent` output handlers so VAD and end-of-turn events flow through the existing addon output queue without changing the default transcript-only streaming behavior.
- Added `examples/example.mic-conversation.js`, a microphone streaming example that logs VAD state, end-of-turn signals, and transcript output from live audio.
- Added C++ unit coverage for `StreamingProcessor` conversation events, JS unit coverage for event forwarding, and a live-stream integration variant that verifies VAD events are emitted with transcript output.

### Changed
- Extended `runStreaming(audioStream, opts?)` TypeScript declarations to include the new conversation streaming options and output event types.

## [0.6.4]

### Changed
- Fixed bug that prevented Vulkan from being turned on by default on linux and windows

## [0.6.3]

### Added
- Vulkan GPU acceleration enabled by default in CMakeLists.txt for Linux, Android, and Windows (macOS/iOS use Metal)
- Dynamic ggml backend library installation in CMakeLists.txt for Android/Linux (matching the LLM addon pattern)
- Vulkan SDK installation on Windows integration test runner so `vulkan-1.dll` is available at runtime
- `atexit` cleanup handler in `binding.cpp` that clears streaming sessions before C++ static destructors run
- Vulkan GPU smoke test in integration test workflow for Linux GPU runners
- RTF performance benchmark workflow with multi-model/multi-audio matrix support

### Changed
- GPU usage is now opt-in: `use_gpu` defaults to `false` in `toWhisperContextParams` instead of inheriting the upstream default (`true`). Callers must explicitly set `use_gpu: true` to enable GPU acceleration.

### Fixed
- Fixed SIGSEGV (exit code 139) at process exit on Linux GPU runners caused by ggml Vulkan backend static destructor ordering (upstream whisper.cpp#2373)
- Fixed "The specified module could not be found" error on Windows integration tests by installing the Vulkan runtime
- Fixed `t.skip()` calls in GPU smoke test (brittle does not support `t.skip`, replaced with `t.pass`)

## [0.6.2]

### Changed
- Fixed chunking issue re-introduced in 0.6.0 in which the inference output was not streamed but instead returned as a single batched result of the end.

## [0.6.1]

### Changed

- Changed `@qvac/transcription-whispercpp` package visibility on NPM from private to public

## [0.6.0]

This release is a significant interface modernisation. The constructor switches to a local-files map, model download is removed from the load path, concurrent inference runs are serialised instead of rejected, and the class no longer extends `BaseInference`.

## Breaking Changes

### Constructor now takes a `files` map instead of loader + model name

The old API accepted a `loader`, `modelName`, `vadModelName`, and `diskPath`. Those are all removed. Pass local file paths directly:

```typescript
// Before
new TranscriptionWhispercpp({ loader, modelName: 'ggml-tiny.bin', diskPath: '/models' }, config)

// After
new TranscriptionWhispercpp({ files: { model: '/models/ggml-tiny.bin', vadModel: '/models/silero-vad.bin' } }, config)
```

`files.model` is required; `files.vadModel` is optional. No download step occurs — files must already exist on disk before calling `load()`.

### `TranscriptionWhispercpp` no longer extends `BaseInference`

The class is now standalone. `instanceof BaseInference` checks and any BaseInference-only APIs (`getApiDefinition`, `downloadWeights`, loader helpers) are no longer available on this class.

### Weight download removed from `_load`

`_load` previously triggered a `WeightsProvider` download when a loader was supplied. That path is gone. Load preparation is now the caller's responsibility.

## New APIs

### `runStreaming(audioStream)` is now part of the public API

The VAD-based live streaming path was previously internal. It is now a documented public method with its own TypeScript declaration, accepting the same audio stream types as `run()`.

```typescript
const response = await model.runStreaming(audioStream)
for await (const segment of response) { /* ... */ }
```

### Concurrent runs serialise instead of throwing

When `exclusiveRun` is enabled (the default), a second call to `run()` or `runStreaming()` while a transcription is in progress will **wait** for the first to complete rather than throwing a `JOB_ALREADY_RUNNING` error. This makes it safe to call `run()` from concurrent contexts.

### New typed exports

`TranscriptionWhispercppFiles` and `InferenceClientState` are now exported from the `TranscriptionWhispercpp` namespace. Lifecycle methods (`load`, `unload`, `destroy`, `cancel`, `pause`, `unpause`, `stop`, `status`, `getState`) are now explicitly declared in `index.d.ts`.

## [0.5.6]

### Changed
- Fixed chunking issue introduced in 0.5.0 in which the inference output was not streamed but instead returned as a single batched result of the end.

## [0.5.5]

### Changed
- Bumped `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` to `1.1.5`.
- Restored JS-owned job ID routing after addon-cpp reverted the accidental `1.1.3` native callback `jobId` contract and `cancel(jobId)` API break.

### Added
- Regression coverage for JS-owned cancel handling of active, buffered, and stale wrapper job IDs.

### Removed
- References of s3 bucket throughout documentation and helper scripts

## [0.5.4]

### Changed

- README: removed outdated npm Personal Access Token / `.npmrc` setup instructions for installing `@qvac/transcription-whispercpp`.

## [0.5.3]

### Changed
- Bumped `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` to `1.1.3`.
- Updated the JS wrapper to consume the shared addon-cpp native job-id callback contract so late cancel/error events remain attached to the cancelled job instead of a newer accepted run.

### Added
- Regression coverage for rejected runs and stale cancel callbacks in the addon inference tests.

## [0.5.2]

Security hardening release from comprehensive security audit.

### Fixed
- Replace global streaming state with per-instance map to eliminate race condition and dangling pointer risk (#1079)
- Add 500 MB buffer limit to audio accumulation to prevent OOM from unbounded buffering (#1080)
- Add SHA-256 integrity verification to model download scripts using HuggingFace LFS checksums (#1081)
- Validate `suppress_regex` parameter — ban grouping constructs (parentheses) and enforce 512-char length limit to prevent ReDoS (#1083)
- Sanitize error messages to remove filesystem paths from thrown errors (#1084)
- Wrap job ID counter at `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` to prevent precision loss (#1085)
- Harden benchmark server: add library allowlist, restrict file paths to allowed directories, remove dynamic `npm install`, add body size limit, restrict CORS to localhost (#1086)

## [0.5.1]

This release documents runtime statistics and transcription output shapes in TypeScript so consumers can type `response.stats` and `run()` results against the native addon.

## New APIs

### `RuntimeStats` and related types in `index.d.ts`

The `TranscriptionWhispercpp` namespace now exports **`RuntimeStats`**, aligned with `WhisperModel::runtimeStats()` (`totalTime`, `realTimeFactor`, `tokensPerSecond`, `audioDurationMs`, `totalSamples`, `totalTokens`, `totalSegments`, `processCalls`, and Whisper-internal timing fields through `totalWallMs`). **`WhisperTranscriptionSegment`** and **`WhisperRunOutput`** describe transcription payloads passed to `onUpdate`. **`run()`** is typed to return **`Promise<QvacResponse<WhisperRunOutput>>`**, with a note that **`response.stats`** matches **`RuntimeStats`** when stats collection is enabled via `opts.stats`.

## [0.5.0]

### Changed
- Migrated the native addon implementation to `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` 1.x (`IModel` + `AddonJs`/`AddonCpp`), replacing the removed legacy templated addon and jobs-handler path
- Updated the JS/native execution path to `createInstance` + `runJob` with parity-focused cancel/output lifecycle handling

### Added
- Expanded C++/JS parity coverage for addon-cpp runtime behavior, including dedicated `AddonCpp` tests

## [0.4.2]
